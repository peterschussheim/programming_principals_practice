// Initialize a 32-bit signed integer with the bit patterns and print the re-
// sult: all zeros, all ones, alternating ones and zeros (starting with a left-
// most one), alternating zeros and ones (starting with a leftmost zero), the
// 110011001100 . . . pattern, the 001100110011 . . . pattern, the pattern of
// all-one bytes and all-zero bytes starting with an all-one byte, the pattern
// of all-one bytes and all-zero bytes starting with an all-zero byte. Repeat
// that exercise with a 32-bit unsigned integer.
