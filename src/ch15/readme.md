# Chapter 15

## Exercises 2 & 3

I had alot of trouble with these exercises, specifically, I couldn't get
Ex 3 working with the precision parameter.  I was having unexpected results
where I would modify the precision with a value other than 1 and the result
was the function no longer showed on the graph.  Additionally, the exercise asked
us to make the type of the precision argument "a template argument for extra
flexibility" however at this point, I am not familiar with templates and did not
want to go down that rabbit hole yet as I am tryng to stick to the book order.

## Exercise 5

What a BRUTAL exercise! My problem with this exercise is that it expects the reader
to understand `std::function` and in general, function pointers, both I have not been introduced to,
yet.  Hopefully I can find time later on to come back to this problem. For now, I will
move on because I must get to part 3: Algorithms ASAP!
